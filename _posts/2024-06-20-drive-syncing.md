Keeping your scientific (or not) data and others safe is a key part of efficient science and work. Here I describe my setup to have my important documents, my research code, my writing versions, etc, all synced on a cloud and on my computers in real time.

	* Disclaimer 1: I am "grandfathered" in MEGAsync, meaning that I signed up to the service when it offered a greater free storage. I have 50Gb for free but signing up for it now will provide you with 20 Gb.
	* Disclaimer 2: I am not paid by MEGA, I just describe the setup that works amazing for me.
	
MEGAsync is a sub-product of the [MEGA cloud service](https://mega.nz), it allows for real time syncing of a folder on your computer, to the cloud folder. Any altered file on a given computer will be updated near-instantly in the drive, and in all other accessible computers. This makes up for several extremely practical uses:
	* Your files are stored online, so whatever happens to your computer now, you can recover your files. If you get a new computer, just add MEGAsync and you will have all of your files.
	* Any deleted file ends in the ".debris" folder, meaning you can recover lost files, even months afterwards, including past versions of some of your files.
	* Perfect computer-switching. I have a laptop that I carry around all the time, its useful in classes, during travels, at home, etc; but I also have a big computer in my lab, for bigger computation and more comfortable work. I can switch between the two computers instantaneously, finding all of my code and datasets where I want them to be.
	* This is very compatible with coding: your python scripts and notebooks, your datasets and other files are always available at the same location in your file hierarchy. I do not sync my python environments but can access all of my code with no compatibility issues.
	* Because you can decide which of you cloud folder is synced on each one of your computers, I keep most of my files synced on all my computers, but I only keep my "important documents" synced on my phone. This folder contains pdfs of important things for me, like scans of ID, university transcripts, diplomas, etc, and I can always access the latest version of all of those documents from my phone or my computers when needed.
	* I sync my scientific paper library on the cloud. I use zotero and make the software pull from a specific folder of my synced folder. I can download a paper on one computer, and access it somewhere else instantaneously.
	
Keep in mind that your are limited in storage amount, and to a daily quota of file transfer per computer. Keep also in mind that large datasets may need to not be in the synced folder. Finally, if your code generates a heavy files, even temporarily, your transfer quota may exceed.
